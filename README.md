WIP Teamfight Tactics (TFT) tool that displays augment stats during augment rounds.

I'm having trouble figuring out how to find out what packages I'm using for this project and 
how to group all the needed packages (especially with Tesseract) so if anyone is reading this 
and knows how please let me know!!!
